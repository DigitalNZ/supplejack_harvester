The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle states:\n\n\u003e Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\n\nWhen you violate DRY, bugs and maintenance problems are sure to follow. Duplicated code has a tendency to both continue to replicate and also to diverge (leaving bugs as two similar implementations differ in subtle ways).\n\n## Tuning\n\n**This issue has a mass of 45**.\n\nWe set useful threshold defaults for the languages we support but you may want to adjust these settings based on your project guidelines.\n\nThe threshold configuration represents the minimum [mass](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/duplication#mass) a code block must have to be analyzed for duplication. The lower the threshold, the more fine-grained the comparison.\n\nIf the engine is too easily reporting duplication, try raising the threshold. If you suspect that the engine isn't catching enough duplication, try lowering the threshold. The best setting tends to differ from language to language.\n\nSee [`codeclimate-duplication`'s documentation](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/duplication) for more information about tuning the mass threshold in your `.codeclimate.yml`.\n\n## Refactorings\n\n*   [Extract Method](http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/extract-method)\n*   [Extract Class](http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/extract-class)\n*   [Form Template Method](http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/form-template-method)\n*   [Introduce Null Object](http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/introduce-null-object)\n*   [Pull Up Method](http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/pull-up-method)\n*   [Pull Up Field](http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/pull-up-field)\n*   [Substitute Algorithm](http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/substitute-algorithm)\n\n## Further Reading\n\n*   [Don't Repeat Yourself](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontRepeatYourself) on the C2 Wiki\n*   [Duplicated Code](http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/duplicated-code) on SourceMaking\n*   [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672) by Martin Fowler. _Duplicated Code_, p76\n"},"severity":"minor"},

Therefore there must be something which 'knows' about the contents or purposes of the arguments.  That thing would have to be more than just a basic type, because the basic types are either containers which don't know about their contents, or they are single objects which can't capture their relationship with their fellows of the same type. So, this thing with the extra knowledge should be reified into a class, and the utility method will most likely belong there.\n\n## Example\n\nRunning Reek on:\n\n```Ruby\nclass Warehouse\n  def sale_price(item)\n    (item.price - item.rebate) * @vat\n  end\nend\n```\n\nwould report:\n\n```Bash\nWarehouse#total_price refers to item more than self (FeatureEnvy)\n```\n\nsince this:\n\n```Ruby\n(item.price - item.rebate)\n```\n\nbelongs to the Item class, not the Warehouse.\n"},"severity":"minor"},

Therefore there must be something which 'knows' about the contents or purposes of the arguments.  That thing would have to be more than just a basic type, because the basic types are either containers which don't know about their contents, or they are single objects which can't capture their relationship with their fellows of the same type.

Therefore there must be something which 'knows' about the contents or purposes of the arguments.  That thing would have to be more than just a basic type, because the basic types are either containers which don't know about their contents, or they are single objects which can't capture their relationship with their fellows of the same type.

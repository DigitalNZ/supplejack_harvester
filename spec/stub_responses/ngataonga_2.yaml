Beginning with pre-eminent full back, Scott; Herbie Cook; Don Clarke from Waikato (most prodigious kicker); Tom Webster from Otago (top notch full back and grand kicker); Jack Goddard from South Canterbury (grand full back). A long list of players’ names are recounted including best first-five-eight, Fred Allen; and best second-five-eight, Ike Proctor.\n\nWinston McCarthy then comments on international play, the BBC, his own commentary and favourite players.\n\nThe Kiwis (New Zealand Service team) were very fit due to their army training and were brilliant in attack. The BBC criticised Winston McCarthy’s accent – apparently, it sounded like Cockney. Nevertheless, the BBC asked him to join them as a Commentator because he was so engaging with his quick-fire approach. Winston talks a little about the Australian and South African tours. He has enjoyed commentating for rowing, golf championships, and tennis. However, he says his best broadcast was actually for a soccer game, a Chatham Cup final a few years ago. Winston then makes his pick for the best team, looking back over the past eleven years.",

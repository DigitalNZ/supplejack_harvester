        "title": "Implications of the second generation intact stability criteria when applied to a NZ offshore patrol vessel",
        "DOI": null,
        "description": "To address the problems of dynamic stability failures, the International Maritime Organisation plan to supersede the intact stability criteria. The draft criteria have been applied to a New Zealand naval patrol vessel to aid in understanding the implication imposed by the revised criteria. This paper addresses how the criteria were applied to the vessel and presents the outcomes of the calculated vulnerabilities. A computational simulation was conducted for the broaching phenomenon using four possible phenomenon-inducing wavelengths. It was found that the patrol vessel broached by more than fifteen degrees over a seven second time period. Therefore, taking into account the simplifications of the analysis, the OPVs, like other vessels, could be deemed vulnerable to the surf-riding and broaching-to phenomenon for these given, operationally avoidable, encounter conditions. Further analysis is recommended when the draft criteria is finalised.",

        "DOI": null,
        "description": "Needle fungi have been extensively studied in conifers but rarely in <i>Pinus radiata</i>. Previous studies of <i>P. radiata</i> have been based on fungal isolation and not direct PCR detection from needles. This research was a component of a study examining factors linked to spring needle cast (SNC) in Tasmanian <i>P. radiata</i> plantations and aimed to identify as many as possible of the fungal species commonly associated with <i>P. radiata</i> needles in Tasmanian plantations. Needle samples were collected from 13 sites representative of the range of sites in which <i>P. radiata</i> is grown in Tasmania. Fungi were detected by a direct PCR approach and identified using barcode sequences from a reference collection of isolates from Tasmania, mainland Australia and New Zealand as well as sequences from the international nucleotide sequence databases. The total number of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) was 152, with 127 detected by direct PCR and sequencing, and only 35 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) isolated by culture-based methods. Dothideomycetes was the most diverse class detected in this study, with many MOTUs detected by direct PCR and not isolated. Leotiomycetes was the second-most diverse class and Sordariomycetes third, with several OTUs frequently isolated but rarely or not at all detected by direct PCR. DNA sequence data facilitated the discrimination and identification of OTUs, but some effort was required to avoid confusion caused by poorly identified isolates in public DNA databases. This is the most comprehensive study yet of fungi associated with pine needles in Australia and highlights the hitherto unrecognised diversity of Teratosphaeriaceae in <i>P. radiata</i>.",

        "title": "Responding to challenges for people with psychotic illness: Updated evidence from the survey of high impact psychosis",
        "DOI": null,
        "description": "<strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> The objective is to summarise recent findings from the 2010 Australian Survey of High Impact Psychosis (SHIP) and examine their implications for future policy and planning to improve mental health, physical health and other circumstances of people with a psychotic disorder.<p></p>    <p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Survey of High Impact Psychosis collected nationally representative data on 1825 people with psychotic illness. Over 60 papers have been published covering key challenges reported by participants: financial problems, loneliness and social isolation, unemployment, poor physical health, uncontrolled symptoms of mental illness, and lack of stable, suitable housing. Findings are summarised under the rubric of participant-ranked top challenges.</p>    <p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The main income source for the majority (85%) of participants was a government benefit. Only one-third was employed, and the most appropriate employment services for this group were under-utilised. High rates of loneliness and social isolation impacted mental and physical health. The rate of cardiometabolic disease was well above the general population rate, and associated risk factors were present from a very young age. Childhood abuse (30.6%), adult violent victimisation (16.4%) and alcohol and substance abuse/dependence (lifetime rates of 50.5% and 54.5%, respectively) complicated the clinical profile. Treatment with medication was suboptimal, with physical health conditions undertreated, a high rate of psychotropic polypharmacy and underutilisation of clozapine in chronic persistent psychotic illness. Only 38.6% received evidence-based psychosocial therapies. In the previous year, 27.4% had changed housing and 12.8% had been homeless, on average for 155 days.</p>    <p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Money, social engagement and employment are the most important challenges for people with psychotic illness, as well as good physical and mental health. An integrated approach to recovery is needed to optimise service delivery and augment evidence-based clinical practice with measures to improve physical health and social circumstances. Meeting these challenges has the potential to reduce costs to government and society, as well as promote recovery.</p>",

The data extracted included information used to characterise the study cohort, the intervention's treatment effects on risk factors and model outcomes. Linear regressions were used to test the relationship between the difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (∆HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and incremental QALYs (∆QALYs) or LE (∆LE) of intervention and control groups. The ratio between the ∆QALYs and ∆LE was calculated and a scatterplot between the ratio and ∆HbA<sub>1c</sub> was used to explore the relationship between these two.</p>    <p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Seventy-six studies were included in this research, contributing to 124 pair of comparators. The pooled regressions indicated that the marginal effect of a 1% HbA<sub>1c</sub> decrease in intervention resulted in an increase in life-time QALYs and LE of 0.371 (95% confidence interval 0.286-0.456) and 0.642 (95% CI 0.494-0.790), respectively. No evidence of heterogeneity between models was found. An inverse exponential relationship was found and fitted between the ratio (∆QALY/∆LE) and ∆HbA<sub>1c</sub>.</p>    <p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> There is a consistent relationship between ∆HbA<sub>1c</sub> and ∆QALYs or ∆LE in cost-effectiveness analyses using type 2 diabetes simulation models. This relationship can be used as a diagnostic tool for decision makers.</p>",

        "description": "<strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> It is currently recommended in Australia that nursing home residents are supplemented daily with 1000 IU vitamin D as they are at an increased risk of fractures. Historically, supplementation has been low, and current supplementation prevalence is not known.<p></p>    <p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D supplementation amongst nursing home residents in Tasmania, Australia.</p>    <p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Resident data, including demographics, medical conditions and medications (including vitamin D and calcium supplement use), exercise and sun exposure, were obtained from residents' files and staff in consenting nursing homes. Dietary calcium intake was estimated from the weekly menu of one nursing home and total calcium intake estimated from this and calcium supplement use. The prevalence of vitamin D supplementation was compared by resident characteristics and fracture risk factors.</p>    <p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Of 811 residents, 409 (50 %) received daily vitamin D supplementation of at least 1000 IU. Residents receiving vitamin D supplementation were slightly younger (mean 83 vs. 85 years for supplemented and unsupplemented groups, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and more likely to have osteoporosis (29 vs. 22 % for supplemented and unsupplemented groups, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.019). Only 43 % of residents with osteoporosis received vitamin D supplements. Most residents (86 %) did not have regular sunlight exposure. The median estimated total calcium intake of 800 ± 275 mg daily was below guideline recommendations of 1000-1300 mg daily.</p>    <p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The prevalence of vitamin D supplementation in nursing home residents was relatively low, suggesting poor adherence to the relevant clinical guidelines. Additionally, most residents do not access sunlight. Interventions addressing this evidence-practice gap are needed.</p>",

We examined whether dialysis treatment utilisation in Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians also differs by gender. <br>  <b>Methods:</b> Using registry data we evaluated 21,832 incident patients (aged ≥18 years) commencing dialysis, 2001-2013. Incidence rates were calculated and multivariate regression modelling used to examine differences in dialysis treatment (modality, location and vascular access creation) by race and gender.<br>  <b>Results:</b> Dialysis incidence was consistently higher in Indigenous women compared to all other groups. Compared to Indigenous women, both non-Indigenous women and men were more likely to receive peritoneal dialysis as their initial treatment (non-Indigenous women RR=1.91, 95%CI 1.55-2.35; non-Indigenous men RR=1.73, 1.40-2.14) and were more likely to commence initial treatment at home (non-Indigenous women RR=2.07, 1.66-2.59; non-Indigenous men RR=1.95, 1.56-2.45).

        "description": "Two cold gas giant planets orbiting a G-type main-sequence star in the galactic disk were previously discovered in the high-magnification microlensing event OGLE-2012-BLG-0026. Here, we present revised host star flux measurements and a refined model for the two-planet system using additional light curve data. We performed high angular resolution adaptive optics imaging with the Keck and Subaru telescopes at two epochs while the source star was still amplified. We detected the lens flux, <i>H</i> = 16.39 ± 0.08. The lens, a disk star, is brighter than predicted from the modeling in the original study. We revisited the light curve modeling using additional photometric data from the B&C telescope in New Zealand and CTIO 1.3 m <i>H</i>-band light curve. We then include the Keck and Subaru adaptive optic observation constraints. The system is composed of a ~4–9 Gyr lens star of <i>M</i><sub>lens</sub> = 1.06 ± 0.05 <i>M</i><sub>⊙</sub> at a distance of <i>D</i><sub>lens</sub> = 4.0 ± 0.3 kpc, orbited by two giant planets of 0.145 ± 0.008 <i>M</i><sub>Jup</sub> and 0.86 ± 0.06 <i>M</i><sub>Jup</sub>, with projected separations of 4.0 ± 0.5 au and 4.8 ± 0.7 au, respectively. Because the lens is brighter than the source star by 16 ± 8% in H, with no other blend within one arcsec, it will be possible to estimate its metallicity using subsequent IR spectroscopy with 8–10 m class telescopes. By adding a constraint on the metallicity it will be possible to refine the age of the system.",

There was underreporting of most relevant symptoms in their hospital files.</p>  <p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong>  PTSD symptoms were probably common during and after World War II. The findings have implications for the management of PTSD generally and the treatment of ageing WWII veterans in particular.</p>",

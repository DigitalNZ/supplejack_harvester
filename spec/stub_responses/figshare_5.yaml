        "DOI": null,
        "description": "Persimmons have been produced in China for over two thousand years with some 950 known cultivars currently existing. The majority of persimmons produced around the world are astringent types, but recent trends in breeding programs in China, Japan, Brazil and Europe, and new plantings in many producing countries around the world, show non-astringent types are gaining in popularity. Worldwide, persimmons are available year round as fresh, dried or processed fruit. Persimmons from Israel can be purchased in Hong Kong and Singapore as “Sharon fruit”. Dried persimmons from China are available throughout the year in most Asian markets. Australian and New Zealand persimmons are now marketed in a number of Southeast Asian countries. In many Asian cultures persimmons hold special significance and are used in religious offerings during festive seasons. The aim of this review is to provide researchers, extension officers and growers with a clear understanding of the origin, botanical taxonomy, classification of persimmons and the varieties available worldwide.",

        "title": "Purpose, Practice and Theory: teacher educators’ beliefs about professional experience",
        "DOI": null,
        "description": "Abstract: The purposes of professional experience within initial teacher education programs are varied (Russell, 2005). However, there is limited literature explaining (a) university-based teacher educators’ beliefs about its purposes and (b) how these purposes are reflected in practice. This study investigated these themes. A pragmatic mixed-method research design (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010) was developed to survey teacher educators from two Australian and New Zealand universities (n = 56). Participants were anonymously surveyed using a diamond ranking activity (requiring placement of 9 of 11 professional experience purpose statement cards, pre-determined from literature) and open response items seeking explanations of placement determining criteria and statement elimination. Following analysis of questionnaire data, focus groups were utilised to further explore the aggregated findings. Survey data were analysed by weighting frequencies of each statement. Analysis of the data indicated significant variation of perspectives amongst the teacher educators and resulted in the clustering of purposes into four groups. This paper presents these data from the Australian university cohort (n = 26). This study, the first of a series designed to elucidate understandings of teacher educators’ purposes for professional experience, reinforces the importance of professional experience as authentic workplace learning within initial teacher education. The findings also reveal the complex beliefs that underpin teacher educators’ practices when preparing, mentoring and supervising preservice teachers for and within professional experience.",

Baseline characteristics of OHSS patients were compared with IVF patients who did not develop OHSS to establish risk factors for the OHSS patient group. Relative risk was estimated using multivariate Poisson regression. A risk score was then developed using the coefficients from the Poisson regression to aid identification of patients at high risk for the condition.</p>    <p><strong>Results: </strong>    The following risk factors were associated with an increased risk of developing OHSS: younger age, higher oestradiol (E2) concentration (relative risk (RR) 1.43, <em>P</em> < 0.001), and higher follicle count (RR 1.40, <em>P</em> < 0.001). Lower body mass index (BMI) was not correlated with an increased risk of developing OHSS (RR 1.1, <em>P</em> = 0.19).</p>    <p><strong>Conclusions:</strong>     This study demonstrates that a risk score can be calculated from routinely taken measurements to identify patients at high risk of OHSS. Using this risk score could help clinicians reduce the incidence of OHSS by employing preventative strategies in high-risk patients.</p>",

        "DOI": null,
        "description": "Although the submergent Kerguelen Plateau  (KP), a large igneous province in the Southern Indian Ocean,  was initiated after the rifting of India from Antarctica, i ts  construction, fed by the Kerguelen hot spot, has taken place  over the past c. 114 m. y. Preliminary shipboard paleontologic  and paleomagnetic dates from ODP Leg 183 on marine  sediments above igneous basement help constraint the  growth history of this feature. The oldest such date is late  Albian (105- 106 Ma or younger) from Site 1136 on the  southern K.P, whereas the youngest is early Oligocene (more  precisely, 34 Ma) from Sites 1139 and 1140 on the northern  KP. Elan Bank provided intermediate ages of late Campanian  (c. 75 Ma); however, Site. 1 138 on the central KP yielded  lower Turonian (c. 93.5 Ma) marine sediments (Cenomanian/  Turonian boundary \"black shales\") above upper Albian -  lowest Cenomanian (c. 102-96 Ma) non-marine (fluvial)  claystones, sandstones, and conglomerates. This latter date  (from shore-based palynology) diminishes considerably the  previously inferred age difference between the southern and  central KP and, in so doing, tends to blur the geophysical  distinction between these two domains.",

Compliance with diet and hypoglycemic medication was correlated. The perceived importance, and the ease of compliance were the principal correlates of patient compliance. Factors independently related to diabetic control were compliance with diet, and the quality of the patient's diet. Diabetes which was poorly controlled, and which was of several-years' standing, was more likely to involve complications. Both poor control and the presence of complications contributed to handicap. Increased dietary education and counselling, with emphasis placed on the importance and benefits of compliance with prescribed diets, may improve control, decrease the incidence of complications, and ultimately minimise handicap due to diabetes in non-insulin-dependent patients.",

        "title": "Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus standard care in the management of postoperative anaemia: a prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trial",
        "DOI": null,
        "description": "<strong>Background:</strong> Despite increasing efforts in perioperative management, postoperative iron deficiency anaemia persists, and few data are available about the management of this condition. In this study, we aimed to determine whether giving postoperative intravenous iron (in the form of ferric carboxymaltose) improved iron stores, haemoglobin concentrations, and outcomes following surgery.<p></p>    <p><strong>Methods:</strong> We did a prospective, open-label, randomised, controlled study of patients at two centres (a general hospital and a private health-care centre) in Tasmania, Australia, undergoing elective surgery with functional iron deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin 70–120 g/L and ferritin ≤100 μg/L or iron saturation ≤20%), measured at day 1 postoperatively. Consecutive routine elective surgical patients who were having major orthopaedic surgery, abdominal, and genitourinary surgery, and other surgeries were recruited. Via computer-generated randomisation, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either a single dose of intravenous 1000 mg ferric carboxymaltose (intervention group) or standard care, consisting of observation (control group). The primary endpoints were changes in haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores at 4 weeks postoperatively, and the number of transfused units of blood required postoperatively until discharge. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry platform (number ACTRN12614001261606).</p>    <p><strong>Findings:</strong> Between Dec 17, 2014, and May 7, 2015, we recruited 201 eligible patients, assigning 103 to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose and 98 to standard care only. Baseline mean haemoglobin was 105·5 g/L (SD 13·8) in the standard care group versus 106·2 g/L (11·9) in the ferric carboxymaltose group, improving at 4 weeks to 121·5 g/L (SD 14·5) in the standard group and 130·1 g/L (11·3) in the ferric carboxymaltose group (mean difference of 7·84 g/L, 95% CI 3·79–11·9; p<0·0001 in favour of the ferric carboxymaltose group). Significant improvements in serum iron (5·36 μmol/L, 95% CI 3·62–7·09; p<0·0001), iron saturation (11·40%, 95% CI 8·33–14·50; p<0·0001), and serum ferritin concentrations (468 μg/L, 95% CI 355–582; p<0·0001) were also noted in the ferric carboxymaltose group at 4 weeks compared with standard care, although no differences were noted in transferrin concentrations (0·06 g/L, 95% CI −0·97 to 1·09; p=0·62). Fewer transfused blood units were given in the ferric carboxymaltose group (to one of 103 patients [<1%]) than in the standard care group (to five of 98 patients [5%]; incidence rate ratio 0·10; 95% CI 0·01–0·85; p=0·035). No adverse events were observed with ferric carboxymaltose treatment.</p>    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Postoperative intravenous ferric carboxymaltose is a feasible and pragmatic management approach in surgical patients with functional iron deficiency anaemia. Our study suggests that patient blood management guidelines should be updated, incorporating the use of postoperative intravenous iron infusion to optimise patient outcomes. Further trials to assess our approach are warranted.</p>",

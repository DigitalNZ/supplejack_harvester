Every tribe in New Zealand was represented, beginning from the far north right down to Invercargill including Stewart Island and the Chatham Islands.\\n\\nInterviewer: And it was on a volunteer basis, wasn't it?\\n\\nCaptain Pirimi Tāhiwi: It was on a voluntary, a volunteer basis. We formed two companies comprising of five hundred men and we were assembled together in Auckland and there came under a Major Peacock who was on the permanent staff, he was a fine man, and we went, we left Wellington on 14 February on the Warimoo, commanded by Captain Edward, and called in at Albany for supplies. We arrived at Gallipoli about a week or two after the landing. Our boys, our Pākehā boys landed on 25th April, well about a week or two afterwards, we landed and we were very fortunate ever to have landed at all. The battalion had been divided up into various groups and the area that is given to Roger and myself was near No. 3 Post.\\n\\nInterviewer: Would you mind telling me the rank and surname of Roger?\\n\\nCaptain Pirimi Tāhiwi: Ah, Roger Dansey, of course, was our company commander, captain, and I was his second in command, Captain Tāhiwi. We had seventy men and we had to attack a certain trench occupied by the enemy and, ah.\\n\\nInterviewer: How many months had you had at Gallipoli before this happened?\\n\\nCaptain Pirimi Tāhiwi: Well, I can't, I can't say definitely - we were there quite a long time. Well, we had seventy men but the officer in command of these other troops here said we that we couldn't have them. He didn't have any to spare so, so we didn't want to, want to go back so we went ahead on our own. Captain Dansey and Lieutenant Hiroti and my brother Corporal Tāhiwi and another man and myself, we went ahead. We decided to attack. Well, we thought a good way to try and frighten the enemy as well was to repeat this Māori haka 'Ka mate, ka mate' when we charged.\\n\\nInterviewer: And you'd hardly be able to see your men in the darkness, would you?\\n\\nCaptain Pirimi Tāhiwi: Ah well, not really but of course there was only a handful of us and we, they were able to follow on, as we went along and as I say we had decided to charge this group and, ah, at the same time doing this Māori haka 'Ka mate, ka mate'. Perhaps that might have put the fear of God into them and cleared the trench for us.\\n\\nInterviewer: Did you have to kill any of the enemy in this action?\\n\\nCaptain Pirimi Tāhiwi: Well, no not as far as I can remember we didn't have to put any bayonet through any of them at all. I suppose the haka was enough for them. They wondered who on earth all these savages were - that was that portion. Well, after that attack we got orders to go back to the beach and have a smoko, have a rest. And it was during this period when a Turkish bullet got me. Shoot me right through the neck and the bullet went right down the spine, paralysing the whole of my right side. Fortunately for me, Dr. Hiroa, Dr. Buck was alongside me and I can still remember now that he put his finger right through the hole in my neck, and I call still remember him saying, \\\"You're alright Prim, don't worry you're alright\\\". Then I didn't remember any more and I found myself up in England.\\n\\nTranscript by Sound Archives/Ngā Taonga Kōrero\",\"full_page_content\":null,\"credits\":[],\"year\":[1968],\"landing_url\":null,\"duration\":\"00:06:46\",\"form\":null,\"viewing_location\":null,\"production_company\":null,\"linked_name1\":null,\"linked_name2\":null,\"linked_name3\":null,\"linked_name4\":null,\"linked_name5\":null,\"linked_url1\":null,\"linked_url2\":null,\"linked_url3\":null,\"linked_url4\":null,\"linked_url5\":null,\"medianet\":null,\"online_content\":null,\"source\":\"Sound Collection\",\"file\":[\"http://boost.ngataonga.org.nz/Audio/247036%20.mp3\"],\"member_object\":null,\"related_object\":null,\"phase_desc\":null,\"item_count_notes\":null,\"orientation_desc\":null,\"group_notes\":null,\"prov_notes\":null,\"assoc_notes\":null,\"subject_class\":null,\"subject_place\":null,\"subject_event\":null,\"subject_date\":null,\"au_related\":null,\"subject_person\":null,\"documentation\":null,\"contest\":null,\"primary_prod_place\":null,\"primary_prod_date\":null,\"au_next_term\":null,\"publisher\":null,\"restriction\":null,\"credit_line\":null,\"name_notes\":null,\"place_made\":null,\"variant_title\":null,\"proportion_title\":null,\"date\":\"27 Sep 1968\",\"subject\":[],\"person\":[],\"group_broadcaster\":[],\"person_names\":null,\"transmission_date\":null,\"personalities\":null,\"rights_information\":null,\"digital_bundle_path\":null,\"in_point\":null,\"out_point\":null,\"department\":null,\"has_media\":true,\"sortable_year\":1968},{\"created_at\":\"2019-08-09T13:26:56.514Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2019-11-12T21:32:32.500Z\",\"record_id\":802909,\"reference_number\":\"43358\",\"media_type\":\"AUDIO\",\"thumbnail_url\":null,\"genre\":[\"Interviews (Sound recordings)\",\"Sound recordings\"],\"creator\":null,\"place_of_production\":null,\"photographer\":null,\"authors\":[\"RNZ Collection\",\"Teka, Prince Tui, 1937-1985, Interviewee\",\"te Ua, Henare, 1933-2007, Interviewer\"],\"corp_author\":[],\"state_of_resp\":[],\"series_title\":null,\"location_all\":null,\"subject_headings_calc\":null,\"taonga_maori_collection\":null,\"category\":null,\"title\":\"[Te puna wai kōrero - Prince Tui Teka]\",\"other_title\":null,\"description\":\"\\\"Prince\\\" Tui Teka, entertainer and instrumentalist, speaks with Hēnare Te Ua about his singing career.\\n\\n(The interview takes place at The Jolly Farmer hotel in Drury, south of Auckland,  after one of his performances.)\\n\\nTui says despite spending a lot of time overseas and communting across the Tasman to perform, he will always stay loyal to his 'pub audiences' who gave him his start in show business and holds tight to his Ruatahuna roots.\\n\\nHe speaks about his recording of \\\"E Ipo\\\" and Jae Epae's \\\"Hold on Tight\\\" and his work as an agent for other artists.\\n\\nHe has recently had some small acting roles in films and talks about these.\\n\\nHe explains the story behind the lyrics to his hit \\\"E Ipo\\\", which was written by Ngoingoi Pēwhairangi.

The Ministry was formed in 1939 to produce publicity and propaganda for distribution at home and abroad during the Second World War. This film was not shown in Britain.\\n\\nThe film illustrates what life was like on the Home Front in Aotearoa New Zealand during the Second World War, showing a variety of roles that New Zealanders contributed to the war effort and emphasising the part of women in stepping into work previously only considered suitable for men. Women are shown working as tram conductors, ticket collectors and a variety of other roles, such as transforming wastepaper into medical supplies. The manufacture of weapons, uniforms and equipment are also highlighted, along with the important role of sheep farmers in supplying meat and wool both at home and to the forces overseas.\\n\\nThe film also captures New Zealand army, navy and medical field training, including shots of the Māori Battalion marching. Troops for home defence receive the same training as soldiers in the field and are shown guarding the coastline, power stations and dams, while the mounted home guard traverse larger and often more inaccessible areas of New Zealand. The film concludes by showing the important roles that women played in the territorial service as radio operators, parachute packers and ground crew working on the airfield. \\n\\nFootage in the film includes:\\n   \\nShots around Nelson; Government Gardens and active geothermal areas in Rotorua; mountain and glacier areas. \\n\\nWomen working as tram conductors (Newtown, Wellington) and railway porters (Wellington railway station).\\n\\nWomen spinning, carding and knitting woollen garments for soldiers and shots from a large modern factory mass-producing woollen uniforms.\\n\\nHeavy engineering factories producing a variety of items, including tin helmets being pressed in moulds and women assembling hand grenades.\\n\\nA mounted home guard detachment crossing a river.\\n\\nScenes from home defence troop training and setting up of mobile field hospitals showing army trucks, tents and equipment such as an x-ray machine and operating theatre.\\n\\nShots of women in the territorial service being drilled and inspected.\\n\\nPlease note: the narration heard in this film reflects the time period it was made.

A traditional pōwhiri for manuhiri and the official party of the Catholic diocese, included a number of young people performing action songs and haka. \\n\\nWinds, which brought down marquees, did not dampen the spirits of those organising and attending the festival. Apart from various cultural art forms and activities, there was a magnificent display of paintings of the Māori Madonna.

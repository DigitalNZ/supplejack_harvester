          "description": "Side 1:\nWinston McCarthy narrates a portrait of Australian rugby player W. H. 'Wild Bill' Cerutti. On the field, he was the hardest, roughest, toughest forward Australia ever produced. Off the field, he was the biggest, softest-hearted man you could ever hope to meet. Cerutti began his rugby in New South Wales, getting representative honours against Victoria in 1927, in the days when front row props fought for the loosehead.\nHe visited New Zealand three times as a player - in 1928, 1931, and 1936. He was an Australian grand prop and forward, the type that never gives up; a great character with a quick tongue and a grand sense of humour.\n\nSide 2:\nWinston McCarthy narrates a portrait of genius rugby player, Bob Scott, who he says was the greatest player he has ever seen, calling him a grand student and player of the game. One of the secrets to his success is that he enjoys his game. The balance of the man 'is like that of a ballet dancer'. He was famous for kicking goal in bare feet from the half way line.\n\nIn Australia in 1947 Scott had an incredible season with his goal kicking. In two games on the Sydney cricket ground he kicked five penalties and nine conversions (33 points), and was presented by officials with a special tray with an inlaid inscription. According to Winston McCarthy \"he'll always be the greatest rugby player that has been my privilege to see...The Great Scott, Bob Scott, the master\".",

          "description": "Part 1 of 12\nNew Zealand Broadcasting Unit announcer, Doug Laurenson [Military Service no. 34957] introduces Frank Jopling [Military service number 1314], a young soldier serving with the Long Range Desert Group. Frank's surname cannot be released [at the time of the recording] due to war regulations, but it can be revealed that he comes from a farm in Okoroire. He kept a diary of a journeys across unexplored desert territory. It is the story of the journey he and his companions in the Long Range Desert Group made through the Sea of Sand into Libya. Frank himself reads these excerpts from his diary, which commence on September 5th 1940. [This was the LRDG's first major patrol, to examine all routes leading to Kufra. See The Official War History of the Long Range Desert Group in Libya 1940-41. https://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Epi-c1-WH2-1Epi-e.html]\n\n\n\n5 September\n\n2.00pm The first patrol vehicles moved off from Headquarters. The men are anxious to get going and looking forward to the adventure and excitement of the trip over unmapped country. The air force are working in conjunction with them.\n\n4.00pm Halted in the desert to regroup.\n6.00pm Halted again due to the radiator boiling, however it cooled quickly. So far, no one has got stuck.\n\n\n\nThis item is part of a collection of recordings made by the Mobile Broadcasting Units, which travelled overseas with New Zealand forces between 1940-1945. They recorded New Zealanders' experiences of war and messages to their families and friends, which were sent back home to be played on a weekly radio programme.",

          "description": "An unidentified woman interviews Captain Pirimi Tāhiwi about serving with the Māori First Native Contingent on Gallipoli during World War I.\n\nCaptain Pirimi Tāhiwi: The Māori Battalion was formed and composed from members of every tribe in the country. Every tribe in New Zealand was represented, beginning from the far north right down to Invercargill including Stewart Island and the Chatham Islands.\n\nInterviewer: And it was on a volunteer basis, wasn't it?\n\nCaptain Pirimi Tāhiwi: It was on a voluntary, a volunteer basis. We formed two companies comprising of five hundred men and we were assembled together in Auckland and there came under a Major Peacock who was on the permanent staff, he was a fine man, and we went, we left Wellington on 14 February on the Warimoo, commanded by Captain Edward, and called in at Albany for supplies. We arrived at Gallipoli about a week or two after the landing. Our boys, our Pākehā boys landed on 25th April, well about a week or two afterwards, we landed and we were very fortunate ever to have landed at all. The battalion had been divided up into various groups and the area that is given to Roger and myself was near No. 3 Post.\n\nInterviewer: Would you mind telling me the rank and surname of Roger?\n\nCaptain Pirimi Tāhiwi: Ah, Roger Dansey, of course, was our company commander, captain, and I was his second in command, Captain Tāhiwi. We had seventy men and we had to attack a certain trench occupied by the enemy and, ah.\n\nInterviewer: How many months had you had at Gallipoli before this happened?\n\nCaptain Pirimi Tāhiwi: Well, I can't, I can't say definitely - we were there quite a long time. Well, we had seventy men but the officer in command of these other troops here said we that we couldn't have them. He didn't have any to spare so, so we didn't want to, want to go back so we went ahead on our own. Captain Dansey and Lieutenant Hiroti and my brother Corporal Tāhiwi and another man and myself, we went ahead. We decided to attack. Well, we thought a good way to try and frighten the enemy as well was to repeat this Māori haka 'Ka mate, ka mate' when we charged.\n\nInterviewer: And you'd hardly be able to see your men in the darkness, would you?\n\nCaptain Pirimi Tāhiwi: Ah well, not really but of course there was only a handful of us and we, they were able to follow on, as we went along and as I say we had decided to charge this group and, ah, at the same time doing this Māori haka 'Ka mate, ka mate'. Perhaps that might have put the fear of God into them and cleared the trench for us.\n\nInterviewer: Did you have to kill any of the enemy in this action?\n\nCaptain Pirimi Tāhiwi: Well, no not as far as I can remember we didn't have to put any bayonet through any of them at all. I suppose the haka was enough for them. They wondered who on earth all these savages were - that was that portion. Well, after that attack we got orders to go back to the beach and have a smoko, have a rest. And it was during this period when a Turkish bullet got me. Shoot me right through the neck and the bullet went right down the spine, paralysing the whole of my right side. Fortunately for me, Dr. Hiroa, Dr. Buck was alongside me and I can still remember now that he put his finger right through the hole in my neck, and I call still remember him saying, \"You're alright Prim, don't worry you're alright\". Then I didn't remember any more and I found myself up in England.\n\nTranscript by Sound Archives/Ngā Taonga Kōrero",

The interview ends with Tui introducing the waiata in te reo Māori.",
